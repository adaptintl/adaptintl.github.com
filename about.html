          <h3>Alexander (Sascha) Petersen</h3>
          <p>
            Active in the climate change field since 2005, Sascha has worked as both a climate scientist and with local municipal government.   He worked as a research scientist with Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, one of NOAA’s Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program.  While there, he helped develop regionally specific <a href='http://cses.washington.edu/db/pdf/moteetalslr579.pdf'>projections for sea-level rise in Washington State</a>.  He then used these predictions to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of coastal climate impacts and worked directly with the City of Seattle and King County to evaluate policy response options and adaptation strategies.    
          </p>  
          <p>
            Sascha also worked for the City of Austin’s Climate Protection Program where he led the City’s adaptation efforts through his participation in ICLEI’s (Local Governments for Sustainability) Climate Resilient Communities advisory group and support of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project to assess the local health impacts of climate change.  He also served on the Climate and Energy Technical Advisory Committee for ICLEI’s Star Community Index, helped lay the foundation for the development of a Community Climate Action Plan, and completed municipal and community wide greenhouse gas emissions inventories.  
          </p>
					<p>
						Sascha has a Bachelor's degree in physics from Pomona College and a Master's degree focusing on climate change science and policy from the University of Washington.  Prior to working on climate change, he trained astronauts at the Johnson Space Center.

						With many years experience working as a health care provider in different parts of the world, she is particularly concerned with how climate change will affect human health.   She has a particular affinity for working with low-income and underserved segments of communities which are likely the most vulnerable to climate change.
