          <h3>Linking climate change science with policy and action</h3>
          <p class='service-details'>

          <h3>Community and business climate preparedness planning </h3>
          <p class='service-details'>
	It can be difficult for businesses and local governments to know where to start when it comes to preparing for climate change.  Adaptation International can help by working with clients to bringing in the right stakeholders, create a framework for the development of climate adaptation plans, and coordinate the development and prioritization of adaptation strategies.   This type of planning process will allow clients to discuss climate risks, prepare for climate impacts, and build capacity for extreme weather and climate related emergencies.

          <h3>Tools to mainstream adaptation into planning</h3>
          <p class='service-details'>
	Decision-support and planning tools can help get businesses and communities the climate impact information they need, when they need it.  Truly responding to the issue of climate change, minimizing risk, and taking advantage of new opportunities will require building consideration of potential climate impacts into all levels of planning and decision-making.  Adaptation International helps communities and businesses develop the tools necessary to mainstream consideration of climate change into their everyday actions.
