          <p>
            Active in the climate change field since 2006, Sascha worked 
            closely with the Climate Impacts Group at the University of 
            Washington; the City of Seattle; and King County, 
            Washington to identify the coastal zone impacts of sea-level 
            rise and assess the effectiveness of policy response options.   
          </p>  
          <p>
            He also worked as part of the Climate Protection Program at the 
            City of Austin, Texas to begin evaluating the human health 
            impacts of climate change and set goals for climate 
            preparedness in a variety of areas from drought and 
            flood planning to emergency response and climate refugee support.  
            He has worked with ICLEI to develop a national sustainability 
            index as well as a tool kit for climate change adaptation.  
            Sascha has a Bachelor's degree in physics and a Master's degree 
            focusing on climate change science and policy.
